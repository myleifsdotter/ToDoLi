# ToDoLi
<strong>Education exercise</strong>

Console app project to build a todo list application. The application allows a user to create new tasks, assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to belong to; through a text based user interface via the command-line. The user can edit, mark as done or remove tasks. They can also quit and save the current task list to file, and then restart the application with the former state restored.

The project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 - Version 17.2.4
